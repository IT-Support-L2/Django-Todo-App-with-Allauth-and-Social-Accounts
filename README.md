# Django Todo app with Allauth and social accounts: Google and Facebook.


- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Django, Python, Bootstrap, jQuery, Font Awesome

- Backend: Django, Python

- User management: Allauth

- Social Accounts: Google, Facebook



I ovverriden allauth templates with a tricky technique: I simply looked to the default allauth html pages source code, copy form variables and made the neccessary changes, it's not rocket science but did you thought about it? üòÅ
